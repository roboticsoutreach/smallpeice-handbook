# Workshop

The workshop is available to students for any use of tools.
Note that power tools are available, but can only be operated by volunteers.

## Workshop procedures

A workshop supervisor is allocated for each day, and this role is allocated to a roving mentor
as a secondary position.

To ensure a safe environment and reduce the chance of incidents, the following regulations must be observed:

-   A member of staff must be supervising the workshop whenever it is in use
-   No students can use power tools; this must be done by a member of staff
-   A member of staff that is using power tools cannot also be supervising
-   The workshop must be closed and locked when not in use

A member of staff is either a volunteer, a member of staff from Smallpeice, or a member of staff from ECS.

To clarify, the workshop can operate with just one member of staff **only** when either:

-   No power tools are being operated, or
-   Power tools are being operated but no other competitors are using the workshop

## Competitors using the workshop

As we are keeping the workshop closed when not in use, competitors need to inform a volunteer when they wish to use it.
The volunteer should then inform the workshop supervisor, who will open the workshop as necessary.

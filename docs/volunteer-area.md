# Volunteer area

We have booked room 59/1257 to serve as a volunteer area throughout the week; this is from 08:00 to 23:00 every day.

The space is to be used for the following:

-   A relaxed area for breaks throughout the day
-   A place to store personal possessions, though you do so at your own risk
-   Morning volunteer briefings
-   Volunteer lunches

Please ensure that competitors are not let into the room at any time.

## Lab tours

There are 3 labs to tour:

-   Active Lab
-   High Voltage Lab
-   Nanofabrication Cleanroom

There will also be some robot hacking time in the schedule.

To deal with time and capacity contraints, we will split into 5 tour groups.
These are simply the same consecutive groups that assigned mentors have:

-   Tour Group A
    -   Team 1
    -   Team 2
-   Tour Group B
    -   Team 3
    -   Team 4
-   Tour Group C
    -   Team 5
    -   Team 6
-   Tour Group D
    -   Team 7
    -   Team 8
-   Tour Group E
    -   Team 9
    -   Team 10

Assigned mentors will accompany their corresponding tour groups. Any assigned mentors
that are not familiar with the campus will also be accompied by a volunteer that is.

## Evening Robot Hacking

Robot hacking continues into the evening on Wednesday. To make this easier for us,
we will eat with the students.

## Academic talk

Most, if not all, mentors will attend the academic talk.

## Sponsor talks

We will likely send a couple of volunteers to the sponsor talks, but this will be decided on the day.

## Electronics workshop

The electronics workshop is an opportunity for students to get a hands-on experience of working with
electronics, whilst also making progress on their robot. A variety of components will be available,
along with guides to using them to create sensors for their robot. Teams are only expected to build
the sensors they need, but there are league points available for teams that complete the whole workshop.
The cut-off for this is dinner on Wednesday.

To provide as much support as possible, it is expected that volunteers working in SUSU will return to the
lab for the duration of the electronics workshop.

## Robotics workshop

The robotics workshop will teach the students how to program a robot. We will use the level 3 computing lab
for this, as well as a simulator that they can use to test their code.

## Move to SUSU

In preparation for the competition, teams will move to Building 42.
Not all teams are required to move immediately, but we will work with the following constraints:

-   All teams must have moved to B42 by lunch
-   Teams must remain with their assigned mentor, so both teams must move at the same time
-   Teams should avoid remaining in the lab any longer than strictly necessary

## Lightning talks

The lightning talks are an opportunity for the teams to present their work to each other.
Each team will deliver a short (roughly 2 minutes) presentation on their robot. They are free
to choose the content of this, but may wish to talk about the design, strategy and and particularly
unique features.

Every member of the audience (including volunteers) will have a voting form, on which they can distribute
10 votes between the other teams. They can distribute these however they choose.

Following the voting, the forms will be collected, votes will be counted and the top three teams will be determined.
These teams will be given league points as a reward.

## Mechanics Workshop

The mechanics workshop is designed to support the teams with the initial design and creation of their robot.
This includes assembling the structure of their robot with aluminium extrusion and other materials, as well
as attaching wheels, motors and other accessories.

This also includes attaching boards to their robot and wiring them up.

The provided USB stick contains code that will drive the robot forward with a small amount of power for a small
amount of time. By the end of the workshop, every team should be able to connect the USB stick and observe their
robot moving.

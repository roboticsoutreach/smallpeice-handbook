# Volunteer structure

Throughout the event, volunteers will be part of one of three groups:

-   Assigned mentors
-   Roving mentors
-   Tech

:::info
These roles change for the competition. Details of this are found [here](#).
:::

All mentors will be in the labs, tasked with supporting the students as they design and build their robots.
Overseeing the lab will be the **Event Director**, Alex.

Tech volunteers will be with the **Tech Lead**, Will, in SUSU, preparing the space for the competition on the Friday.
The intention is that this will not take the whole week, so these volunteers will move to the lab once the venue is ready.

As a volunteer, you will find your assigned roles in the published rota.

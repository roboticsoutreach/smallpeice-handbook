# Volunteer structure

Throughout the event, volunteers will be part of one of three groups:

-   Assigned mentors
-   Roving mentors
-   Technical crew

:::info
These roles change for the competition. Details of this are found [here](/competition).
:::

All mentors will be in the labs, tasked with supporting the students as they design and build their robots.
Overseeing the lab will be the **Event Director**, Alex. Most volunteers fall under this area and are divided amongst teams or the lab areas in general.

Volunteers in the technical crew spend the first part of the week in the competition venue preparing it for the events of Friday. This does not take the whole week, and so the crew return to the lab when preparation is complete. They are overseen by the **Tech Lead**, Will. Unlike most work we do, this work requires specialist training and PPE and so volunteers are selected accordingly.

As a volunteer, you will find your assigned roles in the published rota.

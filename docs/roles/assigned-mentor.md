# Assigned Mentor

Assigned mentors are allocated to two consecutive teams, with which they spend
the majority of the week. They are not expected to have technical knowledge,
rather they there to ensure teams make progress on their robots, and to serve
as a first port of call for any questions.

## Responsibilities

-   Ensure their teams are focused and making sufficient progress
-   Answer any general questions about the event
-   Escalate technical questions to roving mentors
-   Raise any issues or concerns with the event director
-   Provide a summary of their teams' progress at each [morning briefing](../morning-briefings)

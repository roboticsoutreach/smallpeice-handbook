# Robot safety

Ensuring that all robots are safe to operate is incredibly important for the safety
of everyone at the event.

For this reason, we should aim to ensure robots are safe at all stages throughout
the event.

## Safety criteria

Robots should be checked against the following criteria:

-   The battery is protected and securely attached to the robot
-   No hazardous sharp edges are present
-   The correct wire gauge is used
-   No loose wires are present
-   Wires are not exposed at terminals; the insulation must extend all the way to the screw terminal but must not itself be screwed down, as this will cause poor contact

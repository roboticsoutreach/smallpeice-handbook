# Morning briefings

Each morning, please arrive in the [volunteer area](./volunteer-area) for 08:25.
The morning briefing will start promptly at 08:30, and last for approximately 15 minutes.

The briefings will consist of:

-   The plan for the day
-   Any items to note from the previous day (such as safety incidents etc.)
-   An overview of where teams are at
    -   This is to allow roving mentors to have an idea of which teams need extra support
-   An opportunity for all volunteers to synchronise and raise suggestions/concerns

You are welcome to bring your own breakfast to the briefings too.

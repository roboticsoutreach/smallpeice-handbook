# Competition

The competition takes place on the Friday, and is the culmination of the teams' work.

Robots play a series of league matches against each other, scoring league points as they do,
which will then be used to determine the starting order in the knockouts. The knockouts eliminate
teams until a winner is determined.

A different set of roles is used during the competition, and this is detailed in the rota.

## Matches

Matches are short windows during which the game is played between robots in the arena.
A match slot is a period of time during which a match takes place; this includes some
time at the start (pre-game), some time at the end (post-game) and the game itself.
The pre-game and post-game time is used for resetting the arena between matches and
getting the next set of robots into the arena.

Screens positioned around the arena provide the timings which are followed by match officials.
It is, however, possible to delay the schedule where necessary.

## Match officials

A number of roles exist to ensure the efficient flow of matches. These include:

-   Head Shepherd

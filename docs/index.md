Welcome to the documentation for volunteers at the Smallpeice Computing, Electronics and Robotics summer school.

Over 5 days, we will help 50 sixth-form students to design, build, program and test fully autonomous robots,
before running a competition for them on the Friday afternoon.

You are not expected to read this handbook in its entirety, though please familiarise yourself with at least the following pages:

-   [Volunteer structure](./volunteer-structure)
